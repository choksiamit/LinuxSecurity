snat MASQUERADE

nat -> rewrite source and or destination addresses
        of ip packets as they pass through a router or firewall

snat -> replaces private ip address to public ip address

netfilter -> enables a linux machine to become a router
snat -> nat table, postrouting chain. 
MASQUERADE -> a special case snat where public ip address
    of a nat router is dynamic

netfilter also uses PAT on the packet.
