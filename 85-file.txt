input output forward custom
iptables -N MYCHAIN
iptables -vnL
iptables -A MYCHAIN -p icm --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP

to invoke this we have to jump from one 
of the standard chains

iptables -A INPUT -j MYCHAIN

packets traverse the input chain
jump to the custom chain
if no action taken in custom chain, 
packet will return to default chain
until they are accepted or dropped

#delete
iptables -X MYCHAIN

only works if all rules are deleted
from the chain.

iptables -vnL

iptables -X MYCHAIN
there is a reference to this chain
from the input chain.
all references have to be removed
