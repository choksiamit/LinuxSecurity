To be consistent with the filenames and paths run the commands on Ubuntu. Install it locally in a VM or at a cloud provider. Use my referral link below to create your account on DigitalOcean and you’ll get $100 in credit over 60 days: https://m.do.co/c/f1d4debf213f

Write your solution in a terminal and test it.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, watch the video again, rewrite the solution and test it again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Save the solution in a file for future reference or recap.
