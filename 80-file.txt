I've always wanted to get some iptables skills, but the task was like a black hole. I've accumulated a lot of links and tutorials, even read some articles, but the topic always remained in a fog of war... Now I can calmly delete all the links, because the course made them obsolete. The best thing about the course is that it's hands-on and reproducible. NOTE: I've used 2 Ubuntu 20.4 Virtual Box VMs and ran them in bridged network, to ease the Host/VM communication.

80. Script - Port Forwarding (DNAT)
Script - Port Forwarding (DNAT)
#!/bin/bash
 
### PORT FORWARDING (DNAT) ###
 
# Port Forwarding is always done on the PREROUTING chain 
 
# flushing nat filter of PREROUTING chain
iptables -t nat -F  PREROUTING
 
 
# all the packets coming to the public IP address of the router and port 80 
# will be port forwarded to 192.168.0.20 and port 80
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.20
 
 
## VARIANTS
 
 
# 1.redirect port 8080 to port 80 
# Internet clients connect to the public IP address of the router and port 8080 and the packets are 
# redirected to the private server with 192.168.0.20 and port 80
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.20:80
 
 
 
#2. Load-Balancing
# On all 5 private servers (192.168.0.20-192.168.0.24)run the same service (e.g. HTTPS)
# The router will pick-up a random private IP from the range and then translate and send (port-forward) the packet to that IP
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.20-192.168.0.24
